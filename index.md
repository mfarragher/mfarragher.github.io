# About me
I'm a **data scientist** and open-source developer with expertise in **healthcare**, **economics** and **statistical inference**.  I have experience with data science projects in sectors such as e-commerce, education & healthcare. ðŸ‘›ðŸ“šðŸ©º  I'm currently studying [MPhil Population Health Sciences](https://www.phs.masters.cam.ac.uk) (_Health Data Science_ stream) at the University of Cambridge. ðŸŽ“

These are data science **packages and apps** I've developed:
- [`appelpy`](https://github.com/mfarragher/appelpy) <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/mfarragher/appelpy.svg?style=flat&color=orange"> : Python package for easier regression modelling
- [`obsidiantools`](https://github.com/mfarragher/obsidiantools) <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/mfarragher/obsidiantools.svg?style=flat&color=orange"> : Python package for analysing [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) vaults
- [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Shiny-epi_2x2_table_measures-blue?style=flat&labelColor=white&logo=RStudio&logoColor=blue)](https://epi-2x2-table-measures.herokuapp.com) : My first R Shiny app hosted on Heroku generates random contingency tables to use for practising calculations of measures of association in epidemiology.

I'm an evangelist for data - I like *speaking* about data (see talks below), *writing* about data projects for and *sharing* [resources](https://github.com/mfarragher/curated-data-science-resources) about data! âš—

I have a background in SaaS, quantitative economics, consulting & data analytics. I tackle projects from multiple perspectives, enabled by the breadth of my experience: I've worked on projects for the public, private & third sectors; developed proprietary and open-source software; experience of traditional education & alternative education; experience of full-time employment & contracting.

## Expertise
- Statistical inference: e.g. A/B testing and experimentation; causal inference
- Machine learning
- Product analytics on variety of data: e.g. user journey optimisation; B2B data; advertising data; textual data
- Business intelligence: developing analytics strategy at enterprise level and supporting analysts' skills development
- Healthcare: e.g. epidemiology, genetics, genomics, public health
- Economics and econometrics

## Tech stack
- **Python:** analytics & statistics packages (e.g. Pandas, Statsmodels, PyMC3), applied machine learning, package development
- **R**, including R Shiny
- Comfortable with the major OSs: my main commercial experience with Mac, but I use Linux and Windows for personal projects
- Business intelligence: Looker; Tableau
- Databases: primarily BigQuery (standard SQL)
- App deployment: e.g. Heroku
- Statistical software: Stata; SPSS
- Jupyter and JupyterLab, on local and virtual machines
- Tech for reproducible data science: e.g. Binder; GNU Make

I've worked in agile teams, with philosophies such as Extreme Programming and Test-driven Development (TDD).

Also have exposure to: Airflow; Docker; MLflow; Kubernetes; Terraform

# Talks ðŸŽ¤
Here is content for my data science talks:
- PyData London Meetup (March 2020 - postponed) :: *Publishing Your First Project on PyPI*
- PyData London 2019 :: *On the Path to Causal Inference*
  - [Video](https://pyvideo.org/pydata-london-2019/on-the-path-to-causal-inference.html) & [Slides](files/PyData%20London%202019%20-%20On%20the%20Path%20to%20Causal%20Inference%20(corrected%20slides).pdf)
  - A primer on causal inference applied to problems in travel technology.  What is causal inference, why is it important and how can we apply it to projects?
- PyCon 2022 talks :: *Connecting those thoughts: Personal knowledge management with Python*
  - [Extra material](https://github.com/mfarragher/mfarragher.github.io/blob/master/files/PyCon%202022%20-%20extra%20material%20for%20talk.md)
