# About me
I'm a data scientist with interests and experience in economics and statistical inference.  I enjoy uncovering patterns from the depths of unstructured data and influencing how people make important business decisions or deploy software - whether they be product teams, executives, clients and the like. üïµ

Check out my open-source library for regression modelling in Python: [`appelpy`](https://github.com/mfarragher/appelpy) (Applied Econometrics Library for Python) üçèü•ß.

I'm an evangelist for data - I like *speaking* about data (see talks below), *writing* about data projects for and *sharing* [resources](https://github.com/mfarragher/curated-data-science-resources) about data! ‚öó

I have a background in SaaS, quantitative economics, consulting & data analytics. I tackle projects from multiple perspectives, enabled by the breadth of my experience: I've worked on projects for the public, private & third sectors; developed proprietary and open-source software; experience of traditional education & alternative education; experience of full-time employment & contracting.

## Expertise
- Statistical inference: e.g. A/B testing and experimentation; causal inference
- Machine learning
- Product analytics on variety of data: e.g. user journey optimisation; B2B data; advertising data; textual data
- Supporting analysts with business intelligence
- Economics and econometrics

## Tech stack
- Comfortable with the major OSs: my main commercial experience with Mac, but I use Linux and Windows for personal projects
- **Python:** analytics & statistics packages (e.g. Pandas, Statsmodels, PyMC3), applied machine learning, package development
- Business intelligence: Looker; Tableau
- Databases: primarily BigQuery (standard SQL)
- Statistical software: Stata; SPSS
- Jupyter and JupyterLab, on local and virtual machines
- Tech for reproducible data science: e.g. Binder; GNU Make

I've worked in agile teams, with philosophies such as Extreme Programming and Test-driven Development (TDD).

Also have exposure to: Airflow; Docker; MLflow; Kubernetes; Terraform

# Talks üé§
Here is content for my data science talks:
- PyData London Meetup (March 2020 - postponed) :: *Publishing Your First Project on PyPI*
- PyData London 2019 :: *On the Path to Causal Inference*
  - [Video](https://pyvideo.org/pydata-london-2019/on-the-path-to-causal-inference.html) & [Slides](files/PyData%20London%202019%20-%20On%20the%20Path%20to%20Causal%20Inference%20(corrected%20slides).pdf)
  - A primer on causal inference applied to problems in travel technology.  What is causal inference, why is it important and how can we apply it to projects?
