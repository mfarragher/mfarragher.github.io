# _Connecting those thoughts_ talk material
Extra material related to the talk content for **_Connecting those thoughts_** (PyCon talks in 2022).

## Intro to PKM
These are some terms that you may see quite commonly in PKM, referring to someone's collection of notes:
- Second brain 🧠
- Digital garden 🌼
- Vault 🔐
- Wiki 📖
- Zettelkasten 🗃

There can be some overlap in those terms.  _Zettelkasten_ literally means 'slip box' in German, with each note captured on an index card.  A note could be named as an idea/concept or even a timestamp.  The sociologist Niklas Luhmann built a collection of almost 90,000 notes in the 20th century in a _Zettelkasten_ system, which has been [digitised](https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de).  The _Zettelkasten_ approach was actually used by many scholars before Luhmann, e.g. Carl Linnaeus captured his notes on thousands of index cards in the 18th century.

Computers have enabled notes to be linked together more easily.  A physical _Zettelkasten_ does not need to have links between notes, but is certainly a structured way of organising notes.

### Connected notes
**Linked thought** is the relation of notes to each other, to form **connected notes**.  This is developed organically over time, e.g.: a note may lead to another distinct idea; a large idea may be reduced further into smaller notes.  With the ability to display links in a note, it is easy to navigate to similar ideas with a mouse click.  Software like Obsidian.md and Roam Research connect notes through wikilinks and can even represent a note system in a graph format.

At least as I understand it, _second brain_ and _digital garden_ refer to a collection of notes that explicitly build upon linked thought.  A _second brain_ is linked notes kept private, whereas a _digital garden_ is publicly available.

### Philosophies for connected notes
There are some of the philosophies for connected notes:
- **Atomic notes:** a PKM system whereby each note represents only one "thing"/idea/concept.  Christian Tietze described his 'principle of atomicity' in a 2013 [blog post](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/create-zettel-from-reading-notes/): "put things which belong together in a _Zettel_, but try to separate concerns from one another".  This terminology of separation of concerns may be familiar to software engineers.  Once notes are atomic, they can be related to their most similar ideas.
- **Evergreen notes:** a PKM system described by [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes).  One of the principles is that notes should be _atomic_.  The evergreen approach is fundamentally that notes are "worth developing over time".  Notes could start off as quick thoughts (seedlings) and then be developed further over time into more fleshed-out ideas.  Linked thought is important here ("Evergreen notes should be densely linked"), as connection to other notes can help discovery and put thoughts into their wider context.

This reinforces how two notes could be used together, via triangulation: to understand another note; to improve comprehension of another note, aided by memory; to imagine/create a new note.  It can take time to do triangulation.
